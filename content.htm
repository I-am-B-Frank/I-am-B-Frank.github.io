<h1>Welcome to HonestLee.Info</h1>

<p>While we will never be as largantumongous (<span class="italic">pronunciation</span>: large-ant-among-us / <span class="italic">definition</span>: extremely freaking huge) as other encyclopedia or tutorial websites, we always endeavor to provide the most accurate, complete, and thorough information available at the time of writing. We not only show how to complete tasks, if applicable, will also show why it failed.</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>The purpose of this website is to compete with the spammers, plagiarists, inaccuracies, and non-credible sources online. During our research efforts, we found many websites simply copy the primary source; if we could not figure it out using the primary source, we sure will not understand it if the information is just copied without further information.</p>

<h2><a href="/games">Games</a></h2>

<p>These pages are for a few PlayStation 1 and 2 games (e.g., <i>Need For Speed, The Warriors, Grand Theft Auto</i>). Pages include walkthroughs, notes, maps, and cheats.</p>

<h2>Privacy and Security</h2>

<p>Because this is an informational website where no user can edit our data, we currently have no reason to create cookies, registration, or collect data; any changes will be properly addressed. We are, however, using Google AdSense, which uses cookies.</p>

<h2>Latest Information</h2>

<p>Content may change and/or information no longer be viable due to technological advances. We will update accordingly. We include a script for each page to document last edits.</p>

<h2>Hyperlinks and Navigation</h2>

<p>External links always open a new tab. <span class="b text-danger">We will not use clickbait links</span> like some shady sites. These are links created in the page, using random text, thinking is related to the article; but is ads.</p>

<h2>Academics</h2>

<p>In this section, you will find our compiled, however incomplete, college coursework. This information provides real-world examples for academic papers specifically for SNHU; however, include others. The papers were written using APA 6 standards; as of 2019, we are on the <a href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/general_format.html" target="_blank">7<sup>th</sup> Edition</a>.</p>

<h2><a href="/how-to">Guides</a></h2>

<p>These pages are mostly for programmers; however, contain info for common users. We no longer install to the C drive unless forced, then move to the D drive. Even if a page seems irrelevant, review as there may be hints and tricks only specified in that page (e.g., how-to install Opera is the only page that explains how to bypass the cookie consent due to GDPR).</p>

<?php echo $ga?>

<h2>Credibility</h2>

<p>We supply the information on apps we use; we will NOT divert to download software to finish the task. We strive to be [somewhat] professional in all our pages, provide some information with unnecessary commentary, and hold ourselves to [some type of] high academic and professional standards.</p>

<p>We will, nevertheless, on some occasions, quite possibly, perhaps throw in some humor intermittently, inconspicuously, and intentionally appearing ignorant. We do not regret this decision; however, both rue and lament it.</p>

<h2>Unhatched Birds on the First Sunday After the Full Moon That Occurs on Or After the Vernal Equinox</h2>

<p>In each page we placed Easter Eggs. There is at least one on each page; some include hints. These are lines from shows/film/online, using homophones, switching/having the images contain it, Waldo/Jenny, referring to characters, and more; this page has 3.</p>
